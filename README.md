# blog-site
### This is a test blog-site v1.

It consists some default blog posts and you can add more info by going to the **`/compose`** route

It is not hosted on a Web server though.

So, you need to host the website locally on **`port 3000`**.

The new version [**`blog-site v2`**](https://github.com/Karthik192/blog-site-v2) contains database to store the blog-content.
