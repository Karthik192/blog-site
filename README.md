# blog-site
### This is a test blog-site v1.

It consists some default blog posts and you can add more info by going to the `/compose` route

It is not hosted on a Web server though.

So, you need to host the website locally on `**port 3000**`.

NoSQL - `MongoDB` is used to store the content which is also hosted locally on the `**default mongoDB port**`.
